#  Human image Segmentation with UNet (MADS Dataset)

This project performs full-body **human segmentation** using a lightweight **UNet-based CNN model**, trained on the **MADS dataset**. The pipeline includes image loading, preprocessing, training, validation, and mask prediction ‚Äî all optimized for use in Google Colab or local environments.
